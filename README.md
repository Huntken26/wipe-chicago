# Wipe Chicago LLC

## Description

This React app was built as a freelance project for a local commericial cleaning business. This application was created using Chakra-ui, emotion/react, undraw.co, email-js, and github pages. Initially, we wanted to have a full stack but it was decided to startoff with the frontend and as the brand builds and more employees/contracts are made- then we will add on the backend portion. Future development will include a employee/client login, appointment setting tools, client reviews component and square payment APIs.
